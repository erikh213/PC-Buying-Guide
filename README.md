## PC-Buying-Guide
#### By Erik Hansen
In this tutorial I'd like to briefly explain the parts needed to build your own PC, and some resources you might find valuable in your search for the best parts.

This buying guide is created for those interested in technology, but don't quite have the adequate background knowledge of PC hardware to build their own PC. This guide is aimed towards someone interested in gaming on their PC, at refresh rates greater than 60fps. I will include all of the parts needed, in order of their importance to the overall performance of your future PC. The hope is that you'll be able to use this PC for many years, as I have since I built mine back in 2017.

*On to the parts list, the first step to your new gaming or work PC*
-----
1. **CPU - Central Processing Unit**

![CPU](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-4.jpg?fit=720%2C480&p=1)

The CPU is arguable the most important part you must consider. It acts as the "brain" of your computer, and completes all of the computations your computer must constantly do to operate. The two main brands to consider are Intel and AMD. AMD is preferred, as I believe their CPU's to be more fairly priced, and especially effective at multitasking with their impressive core architecture. It sits directly on the motherboard and is normally accompanied by a fan, which I will highlight later in the list.

*Recommended Product: [AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 4.5 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WfqPxr/amd-ryzen-7-7700x-45-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000591wof) (~$300)

2. **GPU - Graphics Processing Unit**

![GPU](https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/graphics-card-gpu-feature-image-shutterstock-3.jpg?fit=720%2C720&p=1)

Next in line in importance is the GPU. Otherwise known as the video card, the GPU is tasked with performing the legwork behind image and graphics processing. If you are considering building a gaming PC in particular, the GPU is what you should splurge the most on. It is unlikely that you'll be bottlenecked by your CPU, and the GPU will largely determine the gaming performance of your PC, and provide you with exceptional frame rates for smooth gaming. The two companies that compete in this space are NVIDIA and AMD, and I believe either are great choices provided the price is right.

*Recommended Product: [AMD Radeon RX 7800XT BLACK 16GB](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/xfx-speedster-merc319-amd-radeon-rx-7800xt-black-16gb-gddr6-pci-express-4-0-graphics-card-black/6561517.p?skuId=6561517&extStoreId=602&utm_source=feed&ref=212&loc=18673830169&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPIQ30Px3-8vhpMkKIP-Szv93MjwgYFRSD3zbpzFB5qJyPh93bvFvRxoCkAwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) (~$550)

3. **RAM - Random Access Memory**

![RAM](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NSYr6nsP63PRbdJFMNL5pT-650-80.jpg.webp)

RAM is crucial for the smooth operation of your PC, especially during multitasking and gaming. RAM is considered a volatile memory storage, and as such, is used for holding information temporarily when it would be quicker to do so rather than compute it again. Aim for at least 16GB for a gaming PC, and consider faster speeds for better performance. Brands like Corsair, G.Skill, and Crucial are popular brands, but the brand does not matter here. Choose the cheapest option with the fastest speeds, and always buy dual-channel RAM (8 gb x 8gb or 16 gb x 16 gb). There are always four slots for four RAM sticks on a computer, and the more slots you use, the more efficient they run.

*Recommended Product: [Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3200](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/p6RFf7/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3200c16) (~$80)

4. **Storage - SSD and HDD**

![Storage](https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/What-Is-SSD-Storage-A-Beginners-Guide-Velocitize-1024x465.jpg)

For storage, consider a combination of a fast SSD for your operating system and frequently used programs, and a larger HDD for mass storage. Using a fast SSD like an M.2 for your operating system and favorite games will make booting up your computer and the favorite games lightning-fast. Brands like Samsung, Crucial, and Western Digital are popular choices. Samsung is known for making some of the fastest M.2 storage units on the market, and this can really improve your overall PC experience drastically. However, it is possible to go conservative here at first and upgrade later if need be. Upgrading storage, especially to M.2 drives, is incredibly easy.

*Recommended Products:
  - SSD: [Samsung 970 EVO 1TB NVMe M.2 Internal SSD](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/P4ZFf7/samsung-970-evo-1tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-mz-v7e1t0bw) (~$150)
  - HDD: [Seagate Barracuda 2TB 7200 RPM](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/CbL7YJ/seagate-barracuda-2-tb-35-7200rpm-internal-hard-drive-st2000dm008) (~$50)

5. **Motherboard**

![Motherboard](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/MEDIAX_792452-T2/images/I/81g473bLYvL.jpg)

The motherboard is the foundation that connects all your components, allowing them to work in synchrony. Motherboards come in different sizes, namely: standard ATX, micro-ATX, and mini-ITX. I would choose the standard ATX size if you aren't worried about the size of your computer. However, micro-ATX is a solid middle-ground of compact size and performance. The most important part of choosing a motherboard is to ensure it is compatible with the parts you chose above. This is where sites like [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) come in handy, since you can enter in all of the parts you are considering buying, and the site will do the work of ensuring they work well with eachother. This site was a godsend for me when I was building my first PC.

*Recommended Product: [ASUS ROG Strix B550-F Gaming ATX Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/6bH8TW/asus-rog-strix-b550-f-gaming-atx-am4-motherboard-rog-strix-b550-f-gaming) (~$180)

6. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**

![PSU](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71953BcF5iL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)

The power supply unit is not the most sexy component of a PC build, but a needed one. The biggest factor in your decision should be the rating of the unit and the wattage. I would select a reliable PSU with enough wattage for your components. The ratings go 80 plus bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. They rate the unit based on its overall reliability and efficiency, but all of this doesn't matter too much. Just to be safe, I would chose a unit with at least an 80 plus gold rating. Once again, this is another product that should always be inputted on [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), since each PC setup requires a different level of wattage. Brands like EVGA, Corsair, and Seasonic are known for their quality PSUs.

*Recommended Product: [EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G5, 80 Plus Gold 650W](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/8x7CmG/evga-supernova-650-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-220-g5-0650-x1) (~$90)

7. **PC Case**

![PC Case](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/roundups/05hdyk7k8eQlymJjfyeSfwC-52..v1650497639.jpg)

Choose a case that accommodates your components and provides good airflow, keeping in mind that the size of the case must correspond to the size of your motherboard. Make sure you choose a case that has good room in the back for cable management. If you ever need to change the parts in your PC in the future, you'll thank yourself that you took the time to make those cables nice and tidy. Popular brands include NZXT, Fractal Design, and Phanteks. 

*Recommended Product: [NZXT H510 Compact ATX Mid-Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/6Cyqqs/nzxt-h510-atx-mid-tower-case-ca-h510b-w1) (~$70)

8. **Cooling**

![Cooling](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/14621/NOCTUA_NH-U12A_Car_678x452.jpg)

Consider additional cooling for your CPU and GPU to maintain optimal temperatures. Air coolers and liquid coolers are available from brands like Noctua, be quiet!, and Corsair. I would recommend the air coolers from noctua, as they are top of the line in cooling and are unbelievably quiet. They are a little on the pricy side, but definitely don't go cheap here. If you are building a powerful PC, especially if it's in a smaller form factor case, temperatures could end up bottlenecking your entire system. It's best to stay cool my friend.

*Recommended Product: [Noctua NH-D15S, Premium Dual-Tower CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4vzv6h/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhd15s) (~$80)
